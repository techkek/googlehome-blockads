# Home Assistant Automation

This repository contains a simple automation for Home Assistant. It's designed to enhance your listening experience on any player that uses a service with advertisements. For instance, if you're using Google Nest with Spotify, this automation can mute the device for the duration of the advertisement and then resume at the same volume.

## Generalization

The automation is designed to be generalizable. By changing the 'player' as in the comments and 'Advertisement' with what other manufacturers are showing, you can adapt this automation to work with different devices and services.

## Volume Control

By default, the volume goes back to 20% after an advertisement. However, you can easily adjust this to suit your preferences. Simply change the default volume setting to whatever you like.

Enjoy your ad-free listening experience!
